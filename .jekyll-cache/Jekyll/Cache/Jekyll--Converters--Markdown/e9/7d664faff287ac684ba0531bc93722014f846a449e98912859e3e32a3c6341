I"6<p>I am a senior full stack developer at
<a href="https://pollinate.com/#/">pollinate</a> where I spend my days as part of
the <a href="https://www.spectrumcustomizer.com/">Spectrum Customizer</a>
platform team.</p>

<p>I have extensive frontend experience and I have implemented projects
using Vue and Angular. I take performance seriously and am regularly
tasked with taking memory heavy and CPU intensive projects and finding
a way for them to run on impossibly old mobile phones.</p>

<p>I also work on server side projects using node and .net (C# and F#).</p>
