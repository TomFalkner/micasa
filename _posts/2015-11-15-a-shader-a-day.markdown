I've started to learn webgl and all things three-dee. So I've decided to do one of those programming stunts and try to write a shader a day for 80 days. Starting today. This has meant updating some of the layout of this site. It could use some work.

For now I'm going to try and avoid Three.js while making these.

Here it is in all of its cubical glory: [First Shader][shader-link]



[shader-link]: /shaders/shader-1/
