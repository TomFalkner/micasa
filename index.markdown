I am a senior full stack developer at
[pollinate](https://pollinate.com/#/) where I spend my days as part of
the [Spectrum Customizer](https://www.spectrumcustomizer.com/)
platform team.

I have extensive frontend experience and I have implemented projects
using Vue and Angular. I take performance seriously and am regularly
tasked with taking memory heavy and CPU intensive projects and finding
a way for them to run on impossibly old mobile phones.

I also work on server side projects using node and .net (C# and F#).
